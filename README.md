ðŸŒ¿ Greenden - Plant Store Webpage
I built Greenden, a clean, modern, and responsive plant store webpage using Tailwind CSS. This project is designed for plant lovers to explore different types of plants through a simple and attractive website. The layout is neat, user-friendly, and works perfectly on all devices, including mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

The main goal of this project was to practice using Tailwind CSS and improve my frontend development skills. I learned how to create clean layouts, use utility-first classes, and build a fully responsive design without writing complex CSS. This project also helped me focus on design details and making the website look simple yet professional.

Through this project, I improved my understanding of website structure, spacing, responsiveness, and styling. I also realized how small projects like this help in building confidence and improving coding skills step by step.

Greenden is just the beginning of my journey towards becoming a better web developer. I believe that every mistake teaches something new, and thatâ€™s how we grow.

Thanks for visiting my page!!
